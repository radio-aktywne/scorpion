## Auth using OIDC flows

You can use standard OIDC flows to verify the identity of users.

Check out [`OIDC Debugger`](https://oidcdebugger.com) for a quick test.

All necessary metadata is available at a standard discovery endpoint:
[`http://localhost:20000/.well-known/openid-configuration`](http://localhost:20000/.well-knownopenid-configuration).
